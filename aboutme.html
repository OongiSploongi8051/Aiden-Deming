      <p>If I was to list all the things I am passionate about, I might run out 
      of space on this webpage. From string theory to video game design, anything 
      that remotely resembles unique and interesting things is something worthy 
      of conversation and equally worthy of my energy and passion.</p>

        <p>My educational background falls in the shallow end of the scholastic pool, 
        but what I lack in education, I make up for in intelligence and heart. 
        I am a technology writer for a national award winning journalism program at Don Antonio Lugo High School, 
        and I aspire to be theoretical physicist. I enjoy the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, and I'm a classic movie fan, 
        particularly in the genres of mystery, suspense, sci-fi, and horror films. My favorite movies would also take up 
        even more copy on this webpage, so I'll stop right there. However, I will say Blade Runner, A Quiet Place, Misery, and Children of Men 
        are must-see movies.</p>
